* **Akan** (ak) is a language spoken by the people of Ghana: a country in West Africa. Although Akan is just one of the many local languages spoken in Ghana, is very popular and almost everywhere you go in Ghana, you are likely to find someone who speaks or understand the language. (The national language of Ghana is English).
* **Why Akan?** Even though the Akan language is popularly spoken in Ghana, it very difficult to find softwares, documentations, or technologies using the Akan language. Helping translate Gnome Software stack into Akan may help make this software accessible to many local people.
* **Gnome Software Stack** in this context refers to the softwares and other technologies developed by the [Gnome Foundation](gnome.org), [Gnome Community](community.gnome.org) and other hardworking people. These softwares stack is used to develop the Linux OS and other application, mostly for [Free and Open Source Software](gnu.org).
